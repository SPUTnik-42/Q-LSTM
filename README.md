Q-LSTM

These are the all the files and notebooks i have made for the project they contain multiple versions, but the final or the most recent working models are in delhi_aqi_lstm_LSTM , _QGRU, _5_QLSTM. There are some obvious mistakes (like the faulty RMSE function that I have applied or maybe some error in calculating loss while running the model). 
Some of the repos that I have used for reference are:
